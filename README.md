# Fullstack Barista App
An app that enables a cashier to enter a customer's name and their order. Then that order is added to a queue that the baristas can see and give them the ability to mark an order complete. When the order gets marked as complete the app automatically says the customer's name out loud. Also, completed orders show which barista completed the order.
